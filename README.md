### Links

- Live Site URL: [My live site](https://your-live-site-url.com)

## My process

I began by coding the mobile layout first. I code the HTML part using semantic tags then proceeded to style using CSS. Once the design was responsive, I styled the desktop version using media-queries.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I learnt how to create modern patterns using svg code.
I better understood flexbox and was able to apply properties such as flex-direction and flex-basis to edit the arrangement of columns.
I learnt how to use scalable units such as rem and em to create responsive websites.
I learnt how to edit color in svg code.


```css
<h1>Some CSS code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.one {
    display: flex;
    padding: 0 10em;
    justify-content: flex-start;
    flex-direction: row-reverse;
    align-items: center;
    gap: 4em;
  }
```

### Continued development

I want to focus on perfecting creating responsive sites.

### Useful resources

- [Youtube.com](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3owx2vJHkv4&pp=ygUUcmVkIHN0YXBsZXIgc3ZnIDIwMjI%3D) - This helped learn how to add svg files to make patterns on the site.

- [Mozilla.org](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/flex-direction) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand how to reverse columns and rows. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
